# Teacher Feedback on Documentation and Other Evidence

> This is an ok start, Jayden, but it does need some work. See the comments below. You need to get this up to scratch ASAP - need to be moving on to design stuff.

> Also, please try to use capital letters / punctuation correctly. If you have trouble with this, try to get someone else to read over it with you. 


## System Requirements	

- [x] **A** Purpose of outcome identified and described, listing specific requirements
- [ ] **A** End-users identified and described, listing specific requirements
- [ ] **A** Key functionality that satisfies the purpose and end-user requirements identified
- [ ] **A** Implications, relevant to purpose and end-users, are described and linked to design of outcome
- [ ] **M** UX design principles, relevant to purpose, identified, described and linked to design of outcome

> Lots to sort out...
> - Users - see the exemplar. Should be a description of the two groups of users, what their needs are, etc.
> - Solution / functionality - Needs to be a pretty thorough list of features the system should have - see the exemplars
> - Implications - needs to be done thoroughly. This is Level 3 now.
>    - Usability - needs more detail. Should reference Neillsen, etc.
>    - End-users - needs more detail / info 
> - UX - lots of gaps, plus
>    - Accessible - not correct at all


## Database Structure	

- [ ] **A** Structure of the database is designed (tables, fields, data types, primary keys, relationships, etc.)
- [ ] **M** Structure of the database is logical (i.e. DB is normalised, tables / fields are named logically, etc.)

## Front-End UI Designs

- [ ] **A** Design for key web pages have been sketched out with supporting notes, etc.
- [ ] **E** Design ideas for website are detailed.
- [ ] **E** Design takes into account input from the end users
- [ ] **E** Selection of design features with justification related to requirements / UX principles

## System Testing

### Database Testing

- [ ] **A** Database queries have been tested to ensure that they obtain the required data. Documented evidence of this

> Comments...  

### Functionality Testing

- [ ] **A** Functionality has been tested and there is evidence for this (screenshots, etc.)
- [ ] **M** Testing is thorough (all functionality covered)

> Comments...  

### Code Testing

- [ ] **M** Code (HTML and CSS) validates. Documented evidence for this

> Comments...  

### UX / Usability Testing

- [ ] **M** Relevant UX design principles have been applied and evaluated
- [ ] **E** UX design principles systematically applied and evaluated

> Comments...  

## Improvements Based on Testing

- [ ] **M** Info. from testing has been used to improve the outcome
    - [ ] End-user feedback has been used to improve the system
    - [ ] Evaluation of UX principles have been used to improve the system

### Iterative Improvements

- [ ] **E** Evidence of a series of planned, iterative design-test-improve cycles (at least three) used to refine one or more aspects of outcome
    - [ ] Interaction / UX has been iterated
    - [ ] Design of the UI has been iterated
    - [ ] Implemented UI has been iterated
    - [ ] Implemented functionality has been iterated

## Review and Evaluation

- [ ] **A** Discussion of how the relevant implications were addressed in the implementation of the outcome
- [ ] **A** Discussion of how UX design principles were addressed in the implementation of the outcome
