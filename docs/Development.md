I’m nervous about customers making bookings themselves.  Any requests need to go through to the clinic staff so they can book it.  I am in constant communication with front desk staff – telling them where I am and where I am going next. 

Make sure that any customers booking me, know this. IE any booking needs to be confirmed by the clinic. 

It is a bit concerning that people can see my schedule – I won't be able to have a sleep under a tree in Tapawera! 

Sounds like a good idea – customers can see when I am currently available and get themselves organized in advance. See when we both have time available. 


form Johns feed back I changed the way the is system going to work

and added another page for confirmation just for the manager
