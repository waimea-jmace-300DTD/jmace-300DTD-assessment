# The Design of a Database-Driven Web Application for NCEA Level 3

Project Name: **VetLife page** 

Project Author: **Jayden Mace**

Assessment Standards: **91902** and **91903**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

my dad is a vet and if his clients want to talk to him they must call him this is bad because it interrupts him on his days off

### End-User Requirements

it must have a way to contact him for non emergencies and a phone number to call him and a map of where his place of work is with som info about what some of the people are good at it going to be styled in there colours and have lots of photos of animals its only going to be for the richmond center it needs manager access so the manger can change when people are on it will have forms so you can see when you fav vet is on and book his time and you will be able to cancel it  

### Proposed Solution

Im going to make a website for the richmond VetLife it will allow customers see when there fav vet is on and book his time see, what Expertise the vets there have and what they can do at the clinic with a map of where it is   


-------------------------------------------------

## Relevant Implications

### Usability

Usability means that it is easy too use as most of the people using the site are probably not the most tech savey 

if the users of the website can not use it because it is too hard to use then it is useless so it has to be easy to understand 

I will need to think about making it simple maybe having simbles that are easily identifiable  

### Health & Safety

this mean my website will not have any info that could harm animal if done by untrained hands

it is impotent that i do not give medical advice as people are untrained and my hurt there animals and i don't know anything about animal heath care 

i will need to consider that people may still try to call and ask what they can do or try to look through my website for info on how to save there animals i need to make it clear that the web site is made by someone who has no medical experience and that there will be no info no what to do to a animal just info on the vets and where the vets are and how to contact them  

### End-User

my end users will be my dad and the people he works with  

if I do not make the website design around that so all people can use it it will be useless 

because my dads costumers are mostly farmers not computer science majors I need to make it easy to use for people the use out of data technology   

-------------------------------------------------

## Relevant User Experience (UX) Principles

### Consistency

the use of Consistent colours, symbolise and layout   

it is important that when people come to the website that they are not confused where things are so I need to make the layout the same   

I will need to consider that the people using my website may get confused if the UI changes on every page so it has to stay consistent 

### Accessibility

it means that the people using the website will only be able too see and interacted with the things they are allowed to and allows admins the change the time and dates that people are on   

this is reinvent because it allows for the changing of when people are on with out others messing with the webpage and times

I will need to have accounts for the workers and all the other users can just be guests i need to make sure that no one that is not signed in can see or change anything there not meant to  

### Hierarchy

that there will be a clear difference in what the boss of VetLife the workers and the customers see and interact with 

if the workers can change thing they may get rid of things they do not want to do or mess with other peoples time and if the customers can they might too 

Replace this text with an explanation of what you will need to consider moving forward and how the project will be impacted by this principle.
i will need to have certen resorses available too the admins only and make the pages check if the user is an admin so people don't just go to them ver the URL
